// Project Euler - Sum square difference
// Problem 6
// The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
//
// 12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
// The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
// 
// (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
// Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
//
// Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

// Expected result: 25164150
